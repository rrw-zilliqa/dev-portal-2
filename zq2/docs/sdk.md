# Tools and repositories

Below is a list of useful tools for use with the Zilliqa 2.0 proto-testnet:

### EVM Development Environments
Zilliqa 2.0 features an EVM execution layer and can therefore be used with standard EVM tools and frameworks.</br>
These include popular IDEs such as VSCode, Remix, and many others.


### Neo Savant 2.0
